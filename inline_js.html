    <!-- This line is targeted on mobile devices. It tells them how to render (display) the page. First, you set width of the page to device width. Second parameter is more interesting. Setting initial-scale to 1.0 will cause to render the page in full width. Otherwise, device could display the page zoomed-out – full height – snapshot-like, so users would have to zoom-in every time. The last parameter, user-scalable, is to allow user to zoom-in. The value is yes – zooming allowed – or no. -->

    <!-- First link is to Google fonts CDN. This CDN serves stylesheet for specified font so browser can render it properly. It allows you to use available fonts without worrying if users have that particular installed on their devices.

		Second link is for including reset stylesheet. Reset stylesheet simply changes (reset) the default visual styles of some elements. It removes the margin and padding form lists (also the dots) and body element for example. To do this, I use one from HTML5Doctor.

		Last link is for … yes my main stylesheet. -->
